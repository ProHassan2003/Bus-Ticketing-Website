# Bus Ticket System 🚌

The Bus Ticket System is a console-based application developed to simulate a simple bus reservation process. The program allows users to view available buses, book seats, and display ticket information. This project was created to practice programming fundamentals such as classes, objects, input handling, and program structure.
